title: Storytelling in the digital age; How audio benefits independent authors
---

### by Mónica González Burgos, Advised by Dr. Mike Shier ###

    In this academic study, we are diving into the idea of audio as a means of publication. We explore how the concepts of audiobooks, podcasts and radionovelas have been utilized as both a source of entertainment and a tool for educational purposes since the turn of the century. Given that the principal idea of this study was to come up with a means of audiobook publication that provides easy access to independent authors regardless of their budget, some of these concepts will be used in non traditional ways. For this publication, we will refer to an independent author as someone that self publishes and does not hold a publishing contract with a major publisher or someone whom, despite having a contract with a publisher, self publishes on the side. In addi- tion, we will be using Have and Pedersen’s definition of audiobook from their 2020 publication *The audiobook circuit in digital publishing: Voicing the silent revolution*, in which they exclude from the definition “recordings of texts as well as audio narratives without a coexisting written book – formats that in other contexts would count as audiobooks” (Have & Pedersen 410).
