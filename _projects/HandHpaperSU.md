**ABSTRACT**

Throughout time, the Broadway stage has seen its ups and downs. From the early days of Follies and Oklahoma!, to modern times where works such as The Book of Mormon (TBOM) and Amélie are filled with details that are too hard to miss, some of which hold the power to make or break the production as a whole in a blink of an eye. What makes or breaks a show? If you’re an aspiring producer, this is a question that’ll hunt you on every step of the way. You can have a great story, but if the elements do not transcribe well into musical form, it’s going to be a flop and no one will be able to save it.

For this research, I considered looking into musicals that did not make the cut, but given the obscurity of some of these cases, due to their particular lack of appeal to the general public, I opted instead to research some of the ones that rose above and surpassed all expectations, more specifically, the top musicals within the last two years, Tony Awarded productions Hamilton: An American Musical and Dear Evan Hansen. These shows, between their distinctive topics, their salute to the classics while shining a new light on old techniques, and their widely talented cast and crew members, have broken the stereotype and demonstrated that Broadway shows are more than just sappy show tunes by topping charts and breaking records; and this paper will explore the reasons why.

Let’s begin by explaining what these shows are about and some details about pre production. Dear Evan Hansen (DEH), the most recent recipient of the ever so distinguished Tony Award for Best Musical, amongst another five awards and eight nominations, is about a teenager battling with severe social anxiety and depression, who finds himself pretending to have been best friends with a classmate that has committed suicide. Due to a combination of his desire to stay alive, his need of social acceptance and being in the wrong place at the wrong time; Evan, portrayed by Ben Platt (Pitch Perfect, TBOM second national tour), with the help of his only “family friend,” fabricates a story that he backs up by writing fake emails. After the story goes viral, the web of lies becomes thicker and more unsustainable than ever before, their lives forever changed.

The story of DEH was inspired by an events lived by lyricist Benj Pasek during his high school years and adapted to fit within modern culture and lifestyle. Pre production began in September 2010 and it ended six years later after rewrites, previews and a short off Broadway run before premiering on Broadway in early December 2016. With a $9.5 million investment, songs written by Academy Award winners Justin Paul and Pasek himself (La La Land), direction by Michael Grief (Next to Normal) and a book by Steven Levenson (The Language of Trees), not to mention orchestrations by three time Tony winning composer Alex Lacamoire (In The Heights, Hamilton), although he’s a topic that’ll be addressed later in the paper, it’s hardly a question why this show was the one to beat during the 2016-2017 season, despite its somewhat late entry in the run.

On the opposing side, Hamilton had a smaller crew of creatives during pre production, With Lin Manuel Miranda (In The Heights, 200 Cartas) in charge of book, music and lyrics, Thomas Kail (In The Heights, Grease Live) for direction, and Lacamoire once more on orchestrations. Hamilton resulted in a larger investment, rounding up production costs to a $12.5 million ($3 million over Hansen), and pre production began sometime in 2008 while Miranda was on vacation after his four Tony and one Grammy wins for In The Heights. From pre production to taking the stage, about seven years went by before Hamilton took the Richard Rodgers as a home in July of 2015. After its Broadway debut, Lin’s work took home eleven out of its thirteen possible Tony awards from its sixteen nominations due to the fact that in the leading and featured actor categories, Hamilton had two to three nominations, as well as landing Lin a grammy, a pulitzer, and a MacArthur Genius grant. Hamilton tells the story of first US Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, how he rose from a scrappy orphan immigrant to one of the most influential, yet forgotten founding fathers, told from the perspective of the man who killed him, American Vice-President Aaron Burr with a modern sound, in Miranda’s words, “it’s America then as told by America now.”

Their respective recouping times were significantly different. While DEH just announced that they recouped their investments sometime mid July, eight months after debuting on Broadway, Hamilton managed to recoup 25% of its investment only five weeks into their debut. Now, while they’re isn’t an official announcement as to when they fully recouped, according to a New York Times article from June 2016, by that date they had already recouped months ago. At the rate they recouped their quarter investment, chances are that their recoupment occurred around the five month mark, three months earlier than Hansen, even with their significantly higher amount and is now making $1.9 million per week after two successful years on Broadway, almost double the profit of Hansen in less than a year, which is now making $1 million per week, and that’s without taking into consideration the $1.5 million per week from their Chicago stage, and then the national tour and the upcoming London release. The aforementioned profits are referring to ticket sales only. The prices for these tickets go from $109.00 to $499.00 for Dear Evan Hansen on Broadway, for which a national tour has been announced for 2018, but ticket prices and stops other than their Denver debut are still pending, while Hamilton ticket prices go currently from $444 to $5,700 on Broadway, $279 to $652 in Chicago, $42.28 to $260.18 London (after converting their pound to dollar) and $85 to $750 for their US tour.

Amongst their other incoming revenue, merchandise is a huge deal, for Hamilton at least. After two years on the stage, they have made over $15 million in merchandise sales, including album sales, posters, mugs, t-shirts, Hamilton: The Revolution, which is a book that shows everything pertinent to the production that has hit the NY Times best seller list for non fiction on multiple occasions. While a total of merchandise revenue wasn’t found for DEH, their content is mainly featured on playbill.com for purchase and they have a book with a similar theme as Hamilton: The Revolution coming out in November which is expected to be a success.

Concerning album sales, they’ve both done rather well when you consider how long each show has been running. While Hamilton debuted on the Billboard 200 chart on spot #12, Hansen topped it by taking the spot #8. More impressive is the fact that, according to an article from Entertainment weekly, Hansen’s debut marks the highest debut for a cast album since Camelot arrived at No. 4 in 1961. Another quote I found was from an article from playbill.com that stated that when Hamilton peaked at #3 on the charts “shortly after earning Platinum status in May, only four cast recordings have reached the top 10 on the Billboard 200 in the last 50 years: Hamilton, The Book of Mormon, Hair, and recently, Dear Evan Hansen” with its #8 chart topping debut. At the moment, Hamilton landed Triple Platinum status and current Billboard chart has Hamilton on spot #26 with 97 weeks on the chart, while Hansen holds spot #197, with 21 weeks on the charts. That same Playbill article stated that Now, despite them currently holding spots #12 and #34 respectively on iTunes charts, Hamilton (holder of no. 12) was not the one who landed #1 on this chart, it was Hansen who dethroned Katy Perry’s Witness and The Bricca Family Murders by True Crime Garage this past June, but their influence is so present that even Beyonce’s Lemonade remains a few steps behind at spot #38, four spaces behind Hansen.

Concerning musical elements, I find it interesting that Hamilton’s semi isolated creative process resulted in a literal revolution with so much incoming revenue and a strong presence in the media when compared to Hansen’s collaboration, and most other musical theater works for that matter. However, I have a strong suspicion that there’s a key element here that has enabled these two shows to shine unlike others of their generation, and it’s the orchestration. Four words: Lacamoire. Is. A. Genius. Holder of three Tony Awards, two that were a result of the works discussed throughout this paper, his first thanks to his work from In The Heights, the quality of his work holds a certain level of charm that’s difficult to ignore. A Berkeley College of Music graduate on jazz, arrangement and film scoring, he’s the current music supervisor for Hamilton, despite being partially deaf since age four, coincidentally the year he discovered the piano.

As far as a social media presence concerns, DEH has a long way to go in order to catch up to Hamilton. Overall, Hamilton’s official pages have 677K followers on Facebook, 600K on Twitter, 839K on Instagram and 234.5K on Youtube, while Hansen holds 102K on Facebook, 75K on Twitter, 161K on Instagram and 65.5K on Youtube. As an addition to the previous stats, Hamilton released their official app this past Thursday, which enables users to submit entries for ticket lotteries, purchase merchandise and get the latest news, among other features. The app is currently holding spot No. 93 out of 200 on the apple App Store and a 4.5 star rating, within four days of the release.

Now, what can we take from this research? Perseverance and revisions are key. These two productions took longer than half a decade to come to life, and the results were fruituous. What ever made Hamilton stand out and make history in a more impactful way than Dear Evan Hansen? Probably the integration of many cultures and POCs as opposed to Hansen. Nevertheless, it doesn’t mean that DEH’s contributions have not been significant in their own way. These two had their ups and downs in their respective elements, and Hansen certainly has a lot of time and space to grow, especially since it’s less than a year old. All it’s left to do now is wait and see what’ll come from these two productions along the road, and see what new content the creative masterminds behind them will bring us in the future.
